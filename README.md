## 1. Introduction to Computer Networks

### What is a Computer Network?  
A system of connected computing devices that communicate and share resources like files, printers, and internet.

**Example:** Your home Wi-Fi connects your laptop, phone, and smart TV to the internet and each other.

### Types of Networks

- **LAN (Local Area Network):** Small area like home or office.  
  *Example:* Home Wi-Fi or office Ethernet.  
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Large geographic area, e.g., the Internet.  
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** City-wide or campus network.  
- **PAN (Personal Area Network):** Very small area, within personal reach.  
  *Example:* Bluetooth devices.

### Network Topologies

- **Star:** Devices connect to a central hub or switch. Failure of one device does not affect others.  
- **Bus:** All devices connected on a single cable. If cable fails, whole network goes down.  
- **Ring:** Devices connected in a closed loop, data travels one direction.  
- **Mesh:** Every device connects to every other device, providing redundancy.  
- **Hybrid:** Combination of above topologies.

### Network Models

- **OSI Model:** Conceptual 7-layer model.  
- **TCP/IP Model:** Practical 4-layer model underlying the internet.

## 2. Data Communication Fundamentals

### Components

- **Sender:** Source of data  
- **Receiver:** Destination of data  
- **Medium:** Physical or wireless path  
- **Message:** Data to be sent  
- **Protocol:** Rules governing communication

**Example:** Sending an email using SMTP protocol.

### Data Transmission Modes

- **Simplex:** One-way only (Keyboard to CPU)  
- **Half-Duplex:** Two-way but one at a time (Walkie-talkies)  
- **Full-Duplex:** Two-way simultaneously (Telephone calls)

### Transmission Media

- **Wired:** Twisted Pair, Coaxial, Fiber Optic  
- **Wireless:** Radio waves (Wi-Fi), Microwaves (satellite), Infrared (remote controls)

## 3. Network Devices

- **Repeaters:** Regenerate signals to extend distance  
- **Hubs:** Broadcast incoming data to all ports (inefficient)  
- **Switches:** Forward data to intended device based on MAC address  
- **Bridges:** Connect two LAN segments, filter traffic  
- **Routers:** Connect different networks, forward data based on IP  
- **Gateways:** Translate between different protocols  
- **Modems:** Modulate/demodulate signals for transmission

## 2. What is subnetting? Calculate subnet mask for 192.168.5.0 with 4 subnets.

**Subnetting:**  
Subnetting divides a large network into smaller subnetworks (subnets) to improve management and security. It uses a subnet mask to separate the network and host portions of an IP address.

**Calculation for 4 subnets:**  
- Original Class C IP: 192.168.5.0 with default mask 255.255.255.0 (/24)  
- Number of subnets needed: 4  
- Subnets = 2^n, so n = 2 bits borrowed from host bits (2^2 = 4)  
- New subnet mask: 255.255.255.192 (/26)  
  - Binary mask: 11111111.11111111.11111111.11000000  
- Each subnet has 64 IP addresses (62 usable hosts).

**Subnets:**  
- 192.168.5.0/26 (Hosts: 192.168.5.1 - 192.168.5.62)  
- 192.168.5.64/26  
- 192.168.5.128/26  
- 192.168.5.192/26

|---------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Connection    | Connection-oriented (3-way handshake) | Connectionless                  |
| Reliability   | Reliable, uses acknowledgments and retransmissions | Unreliable, no acknowledgments  |
| Ordering      | Ordered data delivery            | No ordering guarantee          |
| Speed         | Slower due to overhead           | Faster, low overhead           |

## 4. Describe star and mesh topologies with advantages and disadvantages.

**Star Topology:**  
- Devices connect to a central hub or switch.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - Easy to install and manage.  
  - Failure of one device does not affect others.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Central device failure causes entire network downtime.  
  - Requires more cable than bus topology.

**Mesh Topology:**  
- Every device is connected to every other device.  
- **Advantages:**  
  - High redundancy and fault tolerance.  
  - Data can be routed through multiple paths.  
- **Disadvantages:**  
  - Expensive and complex to install.  
  - Difficult to manage with many devices.

## 5. Explain how NAT works and why it is important.

**Network Address Translation (NAT):**  
NAT translates private IP addresses used within a local network to a public IP address before packets are sent to the internet. This allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address.

**Importance:**  
- Conserves public IPv4 addresses.  
- Provides security by hiding internal IP addresses.  
- Allows multiple devices to access the internet simultaneously.

---

## 6. Describe the TCP three-way handshake.

The TCP three-way handshake establishes a reliable connection between client and server.

- **Step 1 (SYN):** Client sends a SYN (synchronize) packet to the server to request a connection.  
- **Step 2 (SYN-ACK):** Server responds with SYN-ACK (synchronize-acknowledge) to acknowledge and agree to connect.  
- **Step 3 (ACK):** Client sends ACK (acknowledge) back to server, completing the connection setup.
